# PDF Word Counter (Rust)

## A simple command-line application written in Rust to count how many times a specific word appears in a PDF file.
## This project is a learning exercise as I explore Rust, file handling, and PDF text extraction.

### 🚀 Features
Accepts a word input from the user.

Reads a PDF file (simple, text-based for now).

Extracts text from the PDF.

Counts how many times the word appears.

CLI-based and minimal — just trying to get it working right!

### 🦀 Built With:
Rust

A PDF reading crate (e.g., pdf or lopdf — will decide as I go)

### 📦 How to Run:
#### Clone this repo:

git clone https://github.com//Tx0sh1/word_count

cd pdf-word-counter

### Build and run the project:

cargo run

Follow the prompt to enter a word and provide a PDF file path. (to be added)

### 📚 Learning Goals
Get comfortable with Rust syntax and best practices.

Learn how to work with external crates.

Understand file and string manipulation in Rust.

Dive into a real-world file format (PDF) and figure out how to extract useful data.

### 📌 Future Improvements
Support scanned/image-based PDFs (maybe using OCR).

Add case-insensitive search.

Support multiple word inputs.

Add CLI arguments instead of user prompt.

Add tests.

### 🧠 Status
Still learning and figuring things out, so expect broken things.
This is just me trying to learn Rust the hard way 😄
