‘There, look.’
‘Where?’
‘Next to the tall kid with the red hair.’
‘Wearing the glasses?’
‘Did you see his face?’
‘Did you see his scar?’
Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory next day. People queuing outside classrooms stood on tiptoe
to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors
again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn’t, because he was trying
to concentrate on finding his way to classes.
There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts:
wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway
up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that
wouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly
the right place, and doors that weren’t really doors at all, but solid
walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where
anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The
people in the portraits kept going to visit each other and Harry
was sure the coats of armour could walk.
The ghosts didn’t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when
one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to
open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new
Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the poltergeist was
worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when
you were late for class. He would drop waste-paper baskets on
your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of
chalk or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose and
screech, ‘GOT YOUR CONK!’
